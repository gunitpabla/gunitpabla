Introducing our innovative Smart Mailbox project, a solution that redefines mail management for the modern era. Driven by ESP32s microcontrollers, the project features a secure door lock controlled by servo motors, ensuring reliable access and heightened security. The integration of a load cell provides accurate weight measurements, offering real-time insights into incoming mail or packages. Utilizing Adafruit technology ensures seamless data transmission over WiFi, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the system. The ultrasonic sensor plays a key role, facilitating secure door unlocking. While we originally aimed for a fingerprint scanner, the ultrasonic sensor provides an intelligent alternative, adding an extra layer of convenience to the user experience. Through IFTTT integration, users can receive instant email notifications upon mail delivery, underscoring the project's commitment to timely and efficient communication. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or seeking streamlined mail retrieval, our Smart Mailbox showcases the practicality and sophistication of smart living in today's digital age.
